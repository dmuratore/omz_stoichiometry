This repository contains the code necessary to recapitulate the analyses and generate figures from the above titled paper Muratore et al 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.11.516076).

To find the 'data' directory with appropriate datasets too large to host on github, please find them on figshare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_files_for_github_omz_stoichiometry_repository/21440592

All bioinformatic analyses regarding cluster computing are archived on Georgia Tech's computing cluster and specific details can be requested to dmuratore at santafe dot edu.

These analyses are all conducted using python v 3.6 and R v 4.1, R scripts list necessary imports in the first few lines.
